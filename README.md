My take on Kaggle`s TPS sep 2021

Available here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-sep-2021/data

The data is quite prepared for analysis with the exception of some missing values. As some of the features have values at completely different scales, I also played
around with scaling. This lent itself nicely to plotting as well, giving me the chance to work on my visualisation skills.

Overall this was a fun project to do that taught me more about scaling, plotting and dataframe building.
